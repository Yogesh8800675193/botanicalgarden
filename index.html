                Botanical
                Garden
            </h2>

            <h3 class="kchbhi">Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, formerly known as the Indian Botanic Garden, is
                a historic botanical garden located in Shibpur, Howrah, near Kolkata, West Bengal. Established in 1787
                by Colonel Robert Kyd, an officer of the British East India Company, the garden is one of the oldest and
                most important botanical gardens in India.

                Spanning over 273 acres, the garden is renowned for its extensive collection of more than 12,000 plant
                species, including rare and exotic varieties. It serves as a hub for botanical research, conservation,
                and education, making significant contributions to the study of Indian flora since its inception. <br>
                <br>

                Among its notable features is the Great Banyan Tree, a sprawling tree estimated to be over 250 years
                old, which holds the distinction of having one of the world’s largest canopies, covering over 4 acres.
                The garden also houses the Central National Herbarium, which contains over 2.5 million plant specimens,
                making it one of the largest plant repositories globally.

                The garden's early focus on economic botany and the acclimatization of foreign plants, such as tea from
                China, helped shape India's agricultural landscape. Today, under the administration of the Botanical
                Survey of India, the garden stands as a testament to India's rich botanical heritage and ongoing efforts
                in plant conservation and research. It is a destination for scientists, students, and nature lovers
                alike, offering a glimpse into the diversity and richness of the plant world.
            </p>

            <h3 class="kchbhi">Visiting hours</h3>

            <p>Open daily from 8 AM to 5:30 PM (March to September) and 8 AM to 5 PM (October to February). Closed on
                Mondays.
            </p>


            <h3 class="kchbhi">Establishment</h3>

            <p>1787: The garden was established by Colonel Robert Kyd, an officer of the British East India Company,
                with the aim of identifying plants of commercial value and developing a sustainable source of timber,
                especially teak, which was in great demand for shipbuilding.</p>

            <h3 class="kchbhi">Early contribution and focus</h3>

            <p>The garden initially focused on economic botany, including the acclimatization and cultivation of plants
                from other regions. It became instrumental in introducing and cultivating several exotic plants,
                including tea from China, which later became a major crop in India.
                It also played a significant role in the study of Indian flora, with botanists documenting a wide
                variety of native plants and trees.</p>


            <h3 class="kchbhi">Role in botanical search</h3>

            <p>The garden became a center for botanical research under the superintendence of William Roxburgh in the
                early 19th century, who is often considered the Father of Indian Botany. Roxburgh made extensive
                contributions to the documentation of Indian flora, and many species discovered during this time were
                named after him.
                The garden’s herbarium, known as the Central National Herbarium, is among the largest in the world,
                housing over 2.5 million specimens.</p>

            <h3 class="kchbhi">Key Features and Notable Trees</h3>

            <p>Great Banyan Tree: One of the garden's most famous attractions is the Great Banyan Tree (Ficus
                benghalensis), which is estimated to be over 250 years old. It has a canopy that spreads over 4 acres,
                supported by thousands of aerial roots, and is often considered the world's largest tree in terms of its
                canopy coverage.
                The garden is home to more than 12,000 plant species, including both native and exotic varieties, such
                as palm trees, orchids, cacti, and medicinal plants.</p>


            <h3 class="kchbhi">Contribution to Tea Cultivation</h3>

            <p>During the 19th century, the garden played a crucial role in the introduction and successful cultivation
                of tea in India, particularly in regions like Assam. This helped establish India as a major tea producer
                globally.</p>

            <h3 class="kchbhi">Renaming and Recent Developments</h3>

            <p>In 2009, the garden was renamed the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden to honor the
                renowned Indian scientist who made significant contributions to botany and plant physiology. <br>
                Today, the garden is under the administration of the Botanical Survey of India and serves as a major
                center for botanical research, conservation, and education.</p>
